Getting Started
===============


If you don't already have `react-natvie`:

  $ npm install -g react-native-cli

If you don't have the android sdk:

  $ emerge android-studio

Install the relavent SDK version for your device and set `ANDROID_HOME`.

  $ export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
  $ export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
  $ export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

Grab the code and install application deps

  $ npm install

Plug in your phone (or use the device emulator), and run the app.

  $ react-native run-android

If you need logs, open another shell

  $ react-native log-android
