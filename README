blog.condi.me
-------------

This is a reimplementation of my blog in python (django).

Getting started
---------------

1/. Run the blog engine

  $ git clone https://github.com/bencord0/blog -b python-django
  $ git clone https://github.com/bencord0/blogposts

You will need access to a postgres instance. Set DATABASE_URL accordingly.
Alternatively, use the Docker instructions below.

  $ (cd blog; make pex)
  $ ./blog/blog.pex manage migrate
  $ ./blog/blog.pex manage import_entries blogposts
  $ (cd blogposts; ../blog/blog.pex)

2/. Report inconsistencies with the live site, and make suggestions.

Docker
------

  $ make docker
  $ make run

Running Tests
-------------

Invoke `tox` without arguments.
        This runs the full test suite against python2 and python3,
        the flake8 linter and produces a coverage report.
        This form is useful in CI environments.

Or `make test`.
        This runs the full test suite using the current environment.
        You may need to `pip install -r test-requirements.txt first.
        This is intended to run in an existing environment.

Finally `make coverage`.
        Like `make test` this will run the full test suite, but
        will also produce a coverage report at the end.
