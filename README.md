blog.condi.me
-------------

This is a reimplementation of my blog in react.

Getting started
---------------

1/. Install dependencies and run the dev server

  $ npm install
  $ npm run start

2/. Report inconsistencies with the live site, and make suggestions.

3/. Build for static hosting

  $ npm run build

Then copy the `build/` directory to a webserver.
This implementation uses the live API at https://blog.condi.me/ for content.
